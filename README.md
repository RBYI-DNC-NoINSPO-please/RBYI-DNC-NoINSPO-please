- [@Paggylyn](https://github.com/Paggylyn) my beloved. 


This is short, but please read before you interact:

- Hi. I'm generally quiet on Pony Town. If none of my friends are online, I'm likely AFK.

- Hazbin Hotel / Helluva Boss, My Hero Academia, Regrevator, or Dream SMP fans please don't interact with me. 

- Tea Knight Cookie cosplayers please don't interact with me.

- If I'm ever with my friend Paggy, for some reason people walk up to us and make uncomfy jokes just because we're cosplaying PureLily. Please don't. I have a bad exeprience with dirty jokes.

- Don't make dirty jokes when talking with me please. And if you have your head in the gutter, maybe don't interact with me, please.

- I'm always comfortable with C + H from anyone if I'm alone. But I'm likely afk. 

- I like to roleplay on Islands.

- Currently recovering, so please be patient with me. I get stressed out by situations easily and tend to randomly leave because of it.

- I like Cookie Run a lot.

- If you think you've seen me before, you have. I had to delete so many internet accounts after a few incidents in the past.
