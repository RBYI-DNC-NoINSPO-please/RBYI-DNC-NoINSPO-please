This is short, but please read before you interact:

- Hi. I'm generally quiet on Pony Town. If none of my friends are online, I'm likely AFK.

- I rarely block or hide. You have to do some genuinely gnarly stuff to get blocked or hidden by me.

- Hazbin Hotel / Helluva Boss, My Hero Academia, Regrevator, or Dream SMP fans please don't interact with me. 

- If I'm ever with my friend Paggy, for some reason people walk up to us and make uncomfy jokes just because we're cosplaying PureLily. Please don't. I have a bad exeprience with dirty jokes.

- Don't make dirty jokes every other sentence. I can tolerate some, just not an excessive amount. And if you have your head in the gutter, maybe don't interact with me, please.

- I'm always comfortable with C + H from anyone if I'm alone. But I'm likely afk. 

- I like to roleplay on Islands.

- I like Cookie Run a lot.

- If you think you've seen me before, you have. I had to delete so many internet accounts after a few incidents in the past.

  Thank you for reading and "🌻𝕄𝕒𝕪 𝕗𝕠𝕣𝕥𝕦𝕟𝕖 𝕓𝕖 𝕦𝕡𝕠𝕟 𝕪𝕠𝕦 𝕥𝕠𝕕𝕒𝕪🌻."
